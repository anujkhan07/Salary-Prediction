# Salary-Prediction  Project 
The Salary Prediction project, typically based on Simple Linear Regression, aims to predict the salary of an employee based on their years of experience. This type of problem is a regression problem in machine learning where the goal is to predict a continuous variable (salary) given a certain feature (years of experience).


The primary goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the salary of an employee based on the number of years of work experience they have.


In a real-world scenario, such a model could be useful for:

1. Human Resource Departments to estimate fair salaries for new hires.

2. Job seekers who want to know what salary to expect based on their experience.

3. Companies trying to benchmark salaries in the industry.
